# Rechnerverwaltung
A simple C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy.

*"18Rechnerverwaltung Klassenhierarchie.png" represents the class hierarchy, part of the exercise.
The project is meant only as an exercise, it cannot be run. The code can be seen by opening "Rechnerverwaltung.sln".*

*Note: german language used.*
